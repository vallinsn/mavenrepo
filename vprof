Jenkins is a open source automation tool written in java with plugins built for continuous integration.
now i understood the concept very well with regards to the git and jenkins integration.
i am able to do changes from both console and command line.
i am also pushing and pulling the changes to github
opening and noticing the changes in the jenkins.
this is really appreciatable efforts and a great development within you
